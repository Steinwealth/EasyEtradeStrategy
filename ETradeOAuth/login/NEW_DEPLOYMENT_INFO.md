## 🛡️ Anti-Phishing Design

### What Changed from Previous Deployment

**OLD Design (Flagged)**:
- ❌ PIN input form visible on public homepage
- ❌ OAuth flow accessible without authentication
- ❌ Triggered Google Safe Browsing phishing detection

**NEW Design (Safe)**:
- ✅ Public page is information-only dashboard
- ✅ No forms, no credential inputs on public page
- ✅ OAuth functionality moved to private, authenticated path
- ✅ Simple access code protection
- ✅ Management page not indexed by search engines
- ✅ Professional business application appearance

### Why This Won't Be Flagged

1. **Public page is purely informational** - No phishing triggers
2. **Forms are private and authenticated** - Hidden from crawlers
3. **Legitimate business design** - Looks like official software dashboard
4. **All compliance maintained** - Full Google AUP adherence
5. **Separation of concerns** - Information vs. functionality

## 🔧 Backend API Configuration

**Note**: The backend API endpoint in the HTML files points to:
```
https://easy-etrade-strategy-oauth-223967598315.us-central1.run.app
```

This is your Cloud Run backend and is still functional. The frontend has changed but connects to the same backend services.

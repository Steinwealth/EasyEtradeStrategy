## Evidence of Legitimacy

### **1. Official API Integration**

## Why False Positive Likely Occurred

The automated security detection likely triggered due to:

### **1. OAuth Authorization Flow**
- Our interface includes E*TRADE authorization URLs
- These may appear suspicious to automated scanners
- Standard OAuth flow includes external redirects

### **2. Token Management Interface**
- Presence of token input fields and OAuth-related terminology
- "Token," "OAuth," "Authorization" keywords may trigger alerts
- Financial services context adds additional scrutiny

### **3. External API Integration**
- Links to E*TRADE's authorization pages
- External redirects during OAuth flow
- API endpoint references

## Business Impact

The suspension of our application has caused:

1. **Trading Interruption:** Automated trading system cannot access required OAuth tokens
2. **Revenue Loss:** Missed trading opportunities during downtime
3. **User Impact:** Authorized users cannot access the token management interface
4. **Development Delays:** Resources diverted to address false positive instead of development

1. **Immediate Review:** Manual review of our application by Google Cloud security team
2. **Suspension Lifting:** Removal of the phishing warning and restoration of service
3. **Whitelist Consideration:** Addition to trusted applications list to prevent future false positives

## Subject: Firebase Hosting Verification Issue - Compliant OAuth Application

Hi Google Search Central Community,

I'm experiencing a technical issue with Firebase hosting and Search Console verification that I hope the community can help with.

**Problem Summary:**
My Firebase hosting site has been blocked by automated detection, preventing Search Console verification.

**Affected Site:**
- etrade-oauth-manager.web.app (Google Cloud AUP Compliant Version)

**Application Details:**
This is a legitimate OAuth token management interface that has been fully redesigned to comply with Google Cloud's Acceptable Use Policy:

- **Purpose:** OAuth token management for automated trading system
- **Developer:** €£$¥ Trading Software Development Team
- **Integration:** Official E*TRADE API using OAuth 1.0a standard
- **Security:** Google Cloud Secret Manager for encrypted credential storage
- **Compliance:** Complete Google Cloud AUP compliance implementation

**Current Situation:**
- Site was working normally
- Suddenly blocked with detection warning
- Cannot access site or complete Search Console verification
- HTML meta tag verification fails because Google can't access blocked site

**Compliance Measures Implemented:**
✅ **Clear Branding:** "Easy OAuth Token Manager - Financial Trading Platform"  
✅ **Developer Identification:** "€£$¥ Trading Software Development Team"  
✅ **Privacy Policy:** Complete data usage transparency  
✅ **Compliance Notices:** Official application and important compliance notices  
✅ **Third-Party Disclosure:** Clear E*TRADE integration and non-affiliation statements  
✅ **Contact Information:** Legitimate business support (eeisenstein86@gmail.com)  
✅ **Anti-Phishing Measures:** No impersonation, no deceptive content, no fake logins  
✅ **Security Headers:** Complete security headers (X-Content-Type-Options, X-Frame-Options, X-XSS-Protection)  
✅ **Google Verification:** Google Search Console verification meta tag included  

**What I've Tried:**
- Submitted appeal via Cloud Dashboard (no response yet)
- HTML meta tag verification fails with "Could not find your site" error
- Deployed verification files but they can't be accessed
- Tried different verification methods

**Technical Issue:**
The verification process requires Google to access the site content, but the site is blocked, creating a circular problem where verification can't complete because the site is inaccessible.

**Specific Questions:**
1. How can I complete Search Console verification when sites are blocked?
2. What's the typical response time for Cloud Dashboard appeals?
3. Are there alternative verification methods for blocked sites?
4. What should I do when appeals don't receive responses?

**Verification Details:**
- Verification Code: GeCz-R-9p6GO5eSAnLloq4GAvvqGNwRRhM3REFwc0NI
- Meta tag already deployed in HTML head section
- Firebase Console accessible and functional

**Evidence of Legitimacy:**
- Firebase Project Ownership: I own the Firebase project and can access Firebase console
- Official API Integration: Uses official E*TRADE API
- Industry Standards: Implements OAuth 1.0a authentication protocol
- Secure Architecture: Google Cloud Secret Manager for encrypted storage
- No Malicious Content: Clean, professional interface with complete compliance measures

I'm seeking guidance on resolving this verification issue and understanding the appeal process timeline.

Thank you for any help or suggestions!

## üîß **Technical Enhancements Implemented**

### **1. Enhanced Quality Thresholds**
```python
# Before (too strict)
min_quality_score = 60.0
min_confidence = 0.70
min_expected_return = 0.025
min_rsi = 54.0

# After (realistic for production)
min_quality_score = 55.0
min_confidence = 0.65
min_expected_return = 0.015
min_rsi = 52.0
max_rsi = 75.0  # Added max RSI
```

### **2. Improved Signal Validation**
```python
# Enhanced validation with multiple factors
def _validate_enhanced_signal(self, quality_scores, market_data):
    # Basic quality checks
    if quality_scores['quality_score'] < self.min_quality_score / 100:
        return False
    
    # RSI range check (52-75)
    if not (self.min_rsi <= current_rsi <= self.max_rsi):
        return False
    
    # Enhanced momentum and pattern checks
    if quality_scores['momentum_score'] < 0.1:
        return False
    
    if quality_scores['pattern_score'] < 0.2:
        return False
    
    return True
```

### **3. Enhanced Profitability Simulation**
```python
# Quality-based win probability
win_probabilities = {
    'low': 0.70,
    'medium': 0.80,
    'high': 0.90,
    'exceptional': 0.95
}

# Strategy-specific multipliers
strategy_multipliers = {
    'standard': 1.0,
    'advanced': 1.2,
    'quantum': 1.5
}

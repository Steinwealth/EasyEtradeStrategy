# 🔍 Complete Trading System Review Checklist

**Review Date**: October 1, 2025  
**Purpose**: Systematic review of V2 ETrade Strategy to confirm all components work correctly  
**Starting Point**: main.py

---

## 📋 Review Methodology

We'll review the system in **5 phases**:

1. **Entry Point & Initialization** (`main.py`)
2. **Core Services** (UnifiedServicesManager)
3. **Trading Pipeline** (Data → Signals → Execution → Monitoring)
4. **OAuth & Integration** (Token management, alerts)
5. **End-to-End Testing** (Complete workflow validation)

---

## 🚀 Phase 1: Entry Point & Initialization

### **main.py Review** ✅

#### **Configuration Loading**
```python
Line 42-95: load_app_config()
```

- [x] System mode (signal_only/full_trading)
- [x] ETrade mode (demo/live)
- [x] Cloud mode detection
- [x] Feature flags (premarket, multi-strategy, news, etc.)

**Status**: ✅ Configuration system looks complete

#### **Logging Setup**
```python
Line 105-150: setup_logging() + setup_cloud_logging()
```

# 📊 Signal-Only Mode Validation Plan

**Date**: October 1, 2025  
**Mode**: Demo + Signal-Only (Sandbox Tokens)  
**Purpose**: Validate complete trading system WITHOUT executing actual trades

---

## ✅ **What Signal-Only Mode Does**

### **System Behavior in Signal-Only Mode:**

```
✅ FULL FUNCTIONALITY:
├─ Watchlist building (7 AM ET daily)
├─ ETrade data access (sandbox tokens)
├─ Symbol feature monitoring (every 2 minutes)
├─ Multi-strategy analysis (all strategies active)
├─ Signal generation (when confirmations pass)
├─ Telegram alerts (Buy/Sell signals sent)
├─ Position tracking (simulated positions)
├─ Stealth trailing stops (simulated monitoring)
├─ Exit signal generation (when conditions met)
└─ End-of-Day reports (trade summary)

❌ DISABLED:
└─ Actual ETrade order execution (NO real trades placed)
```

---

## 🎯 **Expected System Flow (Demo + Signal-Only)**

### **1. Watchlist Generation (7:00 AM ET)**
```
Cloud Scheduler triggers → /api/build-watchlist endpoint
    ↓
build_dynamic_watchlist.py runs
    ↓
Analyzes 109 symbols from core_109.csv
    ↓
Scores by: Volume (30%), Volatility (25%), Momentum (20%), Sentiment (15%), Volume Momentum (10%)
    ↓
Outputs: data/watchlist/dynamic_watchlist.csv (118 symbols sorted)
    ↓
✅ Watchlist ready for trading day
```

**Validation:**
- [ ] Watchlist file created with 118 symbols
- [ ] Symbols sorted by opportunity score
- [ ] Top opportunities have high scores (>40)
- [ ] File timestamp shows today (October 1, 2025)

---

### **2. Trading System Initialization (On Container Start)**
```
main_cloud.py starts → Starts trading thread
    ↓
main.py initializes → UnifiedServicesManager
    ↓
Services initialized:
  • Data Service (ETrade integration)
  • Signal Service (Multi-strategy + Production Signal Generator)
  • Trading Service (Trade execution - disabled in signal_only mode)
    ↓
PrimeTradingSystem.start() called
    ↓
Loads: data/watchlist/dynamic_watchlist.csv
    ↓
✅ Trading thread active (trading_thread_active: true)
```

**Validation:**
- [ ] `trading_thread_active: true` in /status endpoint
- [ ] Logs show "Trading system started in background thread"
- [ ] Logs show "Loaded 118 symbols from data/watchlist/dynamic_watchlist.csv"
- [ ] No import errors or crashes

---

### **3. Watchlist Scanning (Every 2 Minutes, 9:30 AM - 4:00 PM)**
```
Every 2 minutes:
├─ Batch 1: Get quotes for 25 symbols (ELIL, SHPU, NVDL, DFEN, GDXU, BOIL...)
├─ Batch 2: Get quotes for 25 symbols (ERY, BTGD, ERX, ETHD, TSLL...)
├─ Batch 3: Get quotes for 25 symbols (...)
├─ Batch 4: Get quotes for 25 symbols (...)
└─ Batch 5: Get quotes for 18 symbols (last batch)

Total: 5 ETrade API calls per scan

For EACH symbol:
├─ Calculate fresh technical indicators:
│   • RSI (14, 21)
│   • MACD
│   • Moving averages (SMA 20, 50, 200)
│   • Volume ratios
│   • Bollinger Bands
│   • ATR
├─ Multi-Strategy Manager analyzes:
│   • Standard Strategy (requires 6+ confirmations)
│   • Advanced Strategy (requires 8+ score)
│   • Quantum Strategy (requires 10+ quantum score)
│   • RSI Positivity (RSI > 55)
│   • Volume Surging (1.5x volume)
├─ Production Signal Generator validates:
│   • Quality score ≥ 35%
│   • Confidence ≥ 60-90% (strategy-specific)
│   • Expected return ≥ 3%
│   • 2+ strategies must agree
└─ IF ALL PASS:
    ├─ Generate Buy Signal
    ├─ Calculate position size (simulated)
    ├─ Determine confidence emoji (🔰🔰🔰/🔰🔰/🔰/📟/🟡)
    ├─ Send Telegram alert with full details
    └─ Track as "virtual position" (no real trade)
```

**Validation:**
- [ ] Logs show "Scanning 118 symbols for NEW buy signals (2-min interval)..."
- [ ] Logs show "Completed watchlist scan at HH:MM:SS" every 2 minutes
- [ ] ETrade API calls successful (no authentication errors)
- [ ] Multi-strategy analysis running

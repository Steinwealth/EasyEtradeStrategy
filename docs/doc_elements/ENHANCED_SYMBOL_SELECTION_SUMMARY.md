# Enhanced Symbol Selection System - Implementation Summary

## Overview
Enhanced the existing ETrade Strategy system to replace static symbol lists with dynamic, performance-based selection. The improvements integrate seamlessly with the current architecture without disrupting existing functionality.

## Current System Architecture (Preserved)

### Core Components:
1. **scanner.py** - Session supervisor that manages market phases and rebuilds watchlist
2. **build_watchlist.py** - Creates hybrid watchlist from core symbols + movers + volatility scoring
3. **signal_service.py** - Loads watchlist and generates trading signals using strategy_engine.py
4. **strategy_engine.py** - Contains three strategy modes (Standard, Advanced, Quantum)
5. **signals.py** - Rules engine for trade management

### Workflow:
1. **PREP Phase (8:30 AM ET)** - scanner.py triggers watchlist rebuild
2. **Symbol Selection** - build_watchlist.py creates optimized list
3. **Signal Generation** - strategy_engine.py identifies trade candidates
4. **Trade Execution** - signals.py manages entries/exits

## Enhancements Made

### 1. Enhanced build_watchlist.py

#### **Extended Universe (150+ symbols)**
- **Core ETFs**: SPY, QQQ, IWM, DIA, VTI, VEA, VWO, AGG, TLT, GLD
- **Sector ETFs**: XLF, XLE, XLV, XLK, XLI, XLY, XLP, XLU, XLB, XLC
- **Leveraged ETFs**: TQQQ, SQQQ, SOXL, SOXS, LABU, LABD, UVXY, VIXY
- **Major Tech**: AAPL, MSFT, GOOGL, AMZN, META, NVDA, TSLA, NFLX, ADBE, CRM
- **Growth/Momentum**: PLTR, COIN, MARA, RIOT, SMCI, RIVN, LCID, ARKK, ARKW
- **Sector Leaders**: JPM, BAC, WFC, GS, MS, C, AXP, V, MA, JNJ, PFE, UNH

#### **Performance-Based Filtering**
```python
# Automatic removal of poor performers
def _get_poor_performers(performance_data):
    # Excludes symbols with:
    # - 8+ consecutive losses
    # - <45% win rate with 10+ trades

# Prioritization of high performers  
def _get_high_performers(performance_data):
    # Includes symbols with:
    # - >60% win rate
    # - >2% average return
```

#### **Enhanced Scoring**
- **Base Volatility Score**: ATR%, Historical Volatility, Beta
- **Performance Boost**: +20 for high performers, -20 for poor performers
- **Dynamic Ranking**: Combines technical metrics with trading performance

#### **Improved Output**
```
Performance data: 45 symbols tracked
Poor performers to exclude: 3 symbols
High performers to prioritize: 8 symbols

Top 10 symbols selected:
 1. NVDA   Score:  85.2 (Base:  75.2, Boost: +10)
 2. TSLA   Score:  82.1 (Base:  72.1, Boost: +10)
 3. AAPL   Score:  78.9 (Base:  68.9, Boost: +10)
```

### 2. Enhanced modules/symbol_performance_tracker.py

#### **New Functions Added**
```python
def get_symbol_quality_score(symbol: str) -> float:
    """Get quality score based on performance history"""
    
def should_trade_symbol(symbol: str) -> bool:
    """Determine if symbol should be traded"""
```

#### **Integration Points**
- **Quality Scoring**: 0-100 scale based on win rate and returns
- **Trade Decisions**: Automatic exclusion of poor performers
- **Performance Metrics**: Win rate, average return, consecutive losses

### 3. Enhanced modules/strategy_engine.py

#### **Performance Integration**
```python
def generate_signals(self, bar, indicators):
    # Check if symbol should be traded based on performance
    if not should_trade_symbol(bar.symbol):
        return []  # Skip poor performers
    
    # Generate signals as usual
    signals = self._strategy_signals(bar, indicators)
    
    # Enhance with performance data
    for signal in signals:
        signal.metadata['performance_quality_score'] = get_symbol_quality_score(bar.symbol)
        signal.metadata['should_trade'] = should_trade_symbol(bar.symbol)
```

#### **Signal Enhancement**
- **Quality Scores**: Added to signal metadata
- **Trade Validation**: Automatic filtering of poor performers
- **Performance Context**: Historical data included in decisions

### 4. Enhanced scanner.py

#### **Improved Timing**
- **PREP Start**: Changed from 7:00 AM to 8:30 AM ET (1 hour before market open)
- **Better Logging**: Captures output from build_watchlist.py
- **Error Handling**: Enhanced error reporting and recovery

#### **Enhanced Logging**
```
[SCANNER] Rebuilding enhanced hybrid watchlist with performance data...
[WATCHLIST] Performance data: 45 symbols tracked
[WATCHLIST] Poor performers to exclude: 3 symbols
[WATCHLIST] High performers to prioritize: 8 symbols
[SCANNER] Enhanced watchlist build complete.
```

### 5. Enhanced Configuration (configs/base.env)

#### **New Settings Added**
```bash
# Enhanced Symbol Selection
ENABLE_PERFORMANCE_TRACKING=true
REBUILD_WATCHLIST=true
SYMBOL_PERFORMANCE_LOG=data/symbol_performance.json

# Improved Timing
PREP_START_ET=08:30  # 1 hour before market open
```

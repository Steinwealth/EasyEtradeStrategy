🎯 PROBLEM AREAS BY CATEGORY
----------------------------------------

Signal Generation:
  🚨 Linear confidence scoring (quality_score * 1.2) leads to over-optimistic signals
     Impact: High false positive rate, poor signal quality, excessive losing trades
     Solution: Implement non-linear confidence scaling with market regime awareness
  ⚠️ Fixed quality thresholds regardless of market conditions
     Impact: Signals not adapted to market regime, poor performance in different conditions
     Solution: Implement dynamic thresholds based on market regime detection
  ⚠️ Basic signal validation with limited confirmation criteria
     Impact: Low-quality signals pass validation, leading to losing trades
     Solution: Implement multi-factor validation with stricter criteria
  📊 No analysis of signal quality distribution and performance correlation
     Impact: Cannot identify which signal characteristics lead to profitable trades
     Solution: Implement signal quality tracking and performance correlation analysis

Risk Management:
  🚨 Position sizing not properly calibrated for risk/reward ratio
     Impact: Positions too large for risk, amplifying losses
     Solution: Implement proper Kelly Criterion or risk-adjusted position sizing
  ⚠️ No analysis of position correlation, leading to concentrated risk
     Impact: Multiple correlated positions fail together, amplifying losses
     Solution: Implement correlation analysis and position diversification
  ⚠️ Fixed 2% stop loss not adapted to volatility or market conditions
     Impact: Stops too tight in volatile markets, too loose in stable markets
     Solution: Implement ATR-based dynamic stop losses
  📊 No maximum drawdown protection or circuit breakers
     Impact: System continues trading during severe drawdowns
     Solution: Implement drawdown-based position size reduction and circuit breakers

Position Sizing:
  🚨 Position sizes not adjusted based on signal confidence
     Impact: Low-confidence signals get same size as high-confidence, poor risk/reward
     Solution: Implement confidence-based position sizing with proper scaling
  ⚠️ Position sizes not adjusted for symbol volatility
     Impact: High volatility symbols get same size as low volatility, inappropriate risk
     Solution: Implement volatility-adjusted position sizing
  ⚠️ No portfolio-level position sizing constraints
     Impact: Total portfolio risk exceeds acceptable limits
     Solution: Implement portfolio-level risk management and position limits

Exit Strategies:
  ⚠️ Exits triggered too early, cutting profits short
     Impact: Winning trades closed prematurely, reducing overall profitability
     Solution: Implement trailing stops and profit protection mechanisms
  ⚠️ No systematic profit taking strategy
     Impact: Profits not captured systematically, leaving money on the table
     Solution: Implement tiered profit taking with partial exits
  📊 Stop losses not managed dynamically
     Impact: Stops not moved to breakeven or trailed properly
     Solution: Implement dynamic stop loss management with breakeven protection

Market Adaptation:
  🚨 No market regime detection or adaptation
     Impact: Same strategy used in all market conditions, poor performance in adverse conditions
     Solution: Implement market regime detection and adaptive strategy selection
  ⚠️ No awareness of market volatility, trend, or sentiment
     Impact: Signals generated without considering market context
     Solution: Implement market condition analysis and signal filtering
  📊 No tracking of strategy performance across different market conditions
     Impact: Cannot identify which strategies work in which conditions
     Solution: Implement strategy performance tracking and optimization

Strategy Parameters:
  ⚠️ Confidence thresholds may be too low (90% for Standard/Advanced)
     Impact: Low-quality signals accepted, leading to losing trades
     Solution: Increase confidence thresholds and implement stricter validation
  📊 No systematic parameter optimization based on performance
     Impact: Suboptimal parameters not adjusted based on results
     Solution: Implement parameter optimization and backtesting framework
  📊 Same parameters used across all strategies
     Impact: Strategies not optimized for their specific characteristics
     Solution: Implement strategy-specific parameter tuning

Stealth Trailing:
  ⚠️ Stealth trailing system not properly integrated with main trading system
     Impact: Advanced position management not utilized, missing profit opportunities
     Solution: Integrate stealth trailing system with signal generation and execution
  📊 Stealth trailing parameters not adjusted based on signal confidence
     Impact: High-confidence trades not given appropriate trailing treatment
     Solution: Implement confidence-based stealth trailing adjustments

Data Quality:
  📊 No validation of data quality before signal generation
     Impact: Signals generated on poor quality data, leading to false signals
     Solution: Implement data quality validation and filtering
  ℹ️ No tracking of data source reliability and performance
     Impact: Unreliable data sources not identified and replaced
     Solution: Implement data source performance tracking and failover

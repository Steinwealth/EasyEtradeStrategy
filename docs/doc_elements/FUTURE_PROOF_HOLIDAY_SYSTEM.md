## ðŸ§® **Mathematical Algorithms**

### **Easter Calculation (Anonymous Gregorian Algorithm)**
```python
def calculate_easter(year: int) -> date:
    a = year % 19
    b = year // 100
    c = year % 100
    d = b // 4
    e = b % 4
    f = (b + 8) // 25
    g = (b - f + 1) // 3
    h = (19 * a + b - d - g + 15) % 30
    i = c // 4
    k = c % 4
    l = (32 + 2 * e + 2 * i - h - k) % 7
    m = (a + 11 * h + 22 * l) // 451
    n = (h + l - 7 * m + 114) // 31
    p = (h + l - 7 * m + 114) % 31
    return date(year, n, p + 1)
```

### **Nth Weekday Calculation**
```python
def get_nth_weekday_of_month(year: int, month: int, weekday: int, n: int) -> date:
    first_day = date(year, month, 1)
    days_ahead = weekday - first_day.weekday()
    if days_ahead < 0:
        days_ahead += 7
    first_weekday = first_day + timedelta(days=days_ahead)
    return first_weekday + timedelta(weeks=n-1)
```

### **Memorial Day Calculation (Last Monday of May)**
```python
def get_memorial_day(year: int) -> date:
    last_day_of_may = date(year, 6, 1) - timedelta(days=1)
    days_back = last_day_of_may.weekday()  # 0=Monday, 6=Sunday
    return last_day_of_may - timedelta(days=days_back)
```
